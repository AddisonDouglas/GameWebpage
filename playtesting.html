        <div class="description_body">The players suggests we need clearer directions and clearer objectives, including where to bring the food and how to win. They also recommnded item counter for remaining food items.
             The game needs more varied and challenging enemy behavior, better collision detection, and faster character and AI movement. More levels and clearer instructions. 
             Despite these issues, the game was generally well-received.

        <div class="header">Beta</div>
        <div class="description_body">The players suggests the game is currenly far to difficult. 
            Employees move faster than the player, and running out of sprint makes escape nearly impossible. Suggestions include introducing power-ups similar to Pac-Man's special food for temporary enemy destruction, 
            refining mechanics, improving instructions, and addressing bugs like sprinting with held items.

        <div class="header">Relase</div>
        <div class="description_body">Many players found the controls and keybinds awkward and unintuitive, with specific complaints about the sprint functionality being inconsistent, particularly when carrying items. 
            The tutorial was criticized for being cluttered with unnecessary information and poorly placed instructions, making them hard to read due to color and contrast issues, and some text was cut off or grammatically incorrect. 
            Gameplay mechanics were found to be frustrating, with escaping from enemies deemed too difficult as dropping items didnâ€™t help, and players often encountered invisible walls and problematic colliders, especially in level 2. 
            Additionally, enemy AI exhibited erratic behavior near walls, and their view radius was considered too wide, making stealth difficult. Players also suggested improvements like a difficulty slider, clearer lore, and ensuring enemies put 
            back food when they see it.
